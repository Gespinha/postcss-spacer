======= PROCESS =======

    updateLinePattern{
      updateLine{
        addLineSpace

}

- globalProcess runs and looks for all defined types in the options.
- For each defined type, typeProcess runs and defines if the type options have patterns or not.
- If they don't have patterns: updateLine runs and runs addLineSpace on before/after after checking if before/after is set as a valid options.
- If they do have patterns: updateLinePattern runs and checks from all the lines which match any patterns. updateLine will then be run on those that match any patterns and runs addLineSpace on before/after after checking if before/after is set as a valid options.
- Before running any processes check if configured line types are valid and if all of their properties are valid.
- After all the process is finished statusLog is run and displays a summary of the whole process

- when debug mode is set to true, debugLog is run on several instances, printing the lines that were targeted, how many patterns were found in each line and a more comprehensive summary at the end of the process.
